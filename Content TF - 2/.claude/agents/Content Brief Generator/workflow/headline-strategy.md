## SEO Hierarchy Fundamentals

### H1: Main Topic Headline

**Purpose:** Communicate the primary topic and target keyword to both users and search engines.

**Requirements:**
- Exactly **1 H1 per page**
- Must include the **Primary Keyword** naturally
- Should describe what the page is about
- Maximum **60 characters**
- Clear, direct, and outcome-focused
- Uses title case

**Formula:**
```
[Primary Keyword] for [Application/Use Case]
```

**Examples:**
- ✓ Good: "CHO Cell Culture Media for Biopharmaceutical Production"
- ✓ Good: "Single-Use Bioreactors for Cell Therapy Manufacturing"
- ✗ Avoid: "Advanced Solutions for Your Bioprocessing Needs" (no keyword)
- ✗ Avoid: "CHO Media" (too short, lacks context)

---

### H2: Major Content Sections

**Purpose:** Break content into logical sections; each H2 is a subtopic of the H1.

**Requirements:**
- Multiple H2s per page (no more than 5 in a row)
- Each represents a major content area
- Can include Secondary Keywords naturally
- Maximum **60 characters each**
- Should flow in logical order
- Use sentence case

**Common H2 Patterns for Bioprocessing Pages:**

1. **Product/Portfolio Overview**
   - "[Product Category] for [Application]"
   - "Formulations to [Outcome]"
   - "Benefits of [Product]"

2. **Application-Specific Sections**
   - "Solutions for [Specific Use Case]"
   - "Applications for [Product]"
   - "Performance across [Application]"

3. **Technical/Support Sections**
   - "Technical support and documentation"
   - "Scalable global manufacturing capabilities"
   - "Quality and regulatory documentation"

4. **Workflow/Process Sections**
   - "Optimize [Process Stage]"
   - "Workflow integration"
   - "Process development support"

**Examples:**
- ✓ Good: "Optimize CHO workflows with cell culture media"
- ✓ Good: "Solutions to enhance cell culture performance"
- ✓ Good: "Application for CHO media"
- ✓ Good: "Scalable global manufacturing capabilities"
- ✗ Avoid: "Why Choose Us" (self-promotional)
- ✗ Avoid: "The Best Media on the Market" (superlative, prohibited)

### H3: Subtopics Within Sections

**Purpose:** Provide additional structure within H2 sections; drill down into specific details.

**Requirements:**
- Only appear **under H2 sections** (never standalone)
- Represent subtopics of the parent H2
- Typically 2, 3, 4, or 6 H3s per H2 (if used)
- Maximum **60 characters each**
- More specific than H2
- Use sentence case

**When to Use H3s:**

Use H3s when an H2 section covers multiple distinct items:
- Product variants (Serum-Free, Chemically Defined, Classical)
- Application types (mAb Production, Protein Expression, Biosimilars)
- Process stages (Upstream, Downstream, Formulation)
- Service types (Custom Development, Tech Support, Training)

**Don't use H3s when:**
- Content under H2 is cohesive and doesn't need subdivision
- Only one subtopic exists (just keep it in H2)

**Examples:**

```
H2: Solutions for CHO Workflows
H3: Serum-free CHO media
H3: Chemically defined CHO Mmdia
H3: Classical CHO media formulations
```

```
H2: CHO media for various applications
H3: Monoclonal antibody production
H3: Recombinant protein expression
H3: Biosimilar development
```

## Headline Flow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Portfolio Structure

Use when showcasing product/service range:

```
H1: CHO Media

H2: [Product] solutions for [Workflow]
H3: [Product Variant 1]
H3: [Product Variant 2]
H3: [Product Variant 3]

H2: [Product] for [Application]
H3: [Application 1]
H3: [Application 2]

H2: Scalable global manufacturing capabilities

H2: Technical support and documentation
```

---

### Pattern 2: Application-First Structure

Use when targeting specific use cases:

```
H1: [Solution Type] for [Specific Application]

H2: Enhance [Application] Workflow with [Product/Service]

H2: [Product/Service Category] for [Application]
H3: [Specific Product/Service 1]
H3: [Specific Product/Service 2]

H2: Optimize [Process] with [Product/Service]

H2: Quality and regulatory support
```

---

### Pattern 3: Solution-Based Structure

Use when emphasizing integrated solutions:

```
H1: [Solution Name] for [Outcome/Benefit]

H2: Solution Components
H3: [Component 1]
H3: [Component 2]
H3: [Component 3]

H2: Integrate with [Application] [Workflows]

H2: Enable scalable manufacturing quickly

H2: Collaborate with technical specialists
```

---

## Secondary Keyword Integration

**Where to use Secondary Keywords:**
- Naturally in H2 headings where contextually relevant
- In H3 headings for specific subtopics
- Never force keywords unnaturally

**Example:**
- Primary Keyword: "CHO cell culture media"
- Secondary Keywords: "CHO media formulations", "serum-free CHO media", "CHO bioprocessing"

**Integration:**
```
H1: CHO Cell Culture Media for Biopharmaceutical Production

H2: CHO Media Formulations for Different Applications  ← Secondary keyword
H3: Serum-Free CHO Media  ← Secondary keyword
H3: Chemically Defined Formulations

H2: CHO Bioprocessing Workflow Optimization  ← Secondary keyword
```

## Content Gaps and Opportunities

When analyzing competitor headlines (Step 6), look for:

1. **Missing Topics:** What do competitors cover that you don't?
2. **Better Structure:** Can you organize similar content more logically?
3. **Keyword Opportunities:** Are competitors missing obvious keywords?
4. **Depth Differences:** Do competitors go deeper or stay high-level?
5. **Unique Angles:** What can you offer that competitors don't?

---

## Messaging Pillar Integration

Align headlines with Thermo Fisher's five messaging pillars where relevant:

1. **Accelerate time to market**
   - "Rapid Development Solutions"
   - "Fast-Track Workflow"
   - "Accelerated Process Development"

2. **Maximize resource efficiency**
   - "Optimized Workflows"
   - "Efficient Manufacturing"
   - "Resource Optimization"

3. **Enable high product yield and efficacy**
   - "High-Yield Solutions"
   - "Enhanced Productivity"
   - "Yield Optimization"

4. **Deliver on sustainability**
   - "Sustainable Manufacturing"
   - "Environmentally Responsible Solutions"

5. **Reduce risk in supply and regulatory**
   - "Quality and Regulatory Support"
   - "Reliable Supply Chain"
   - "Regulatory Documentation"

---

## Character Limit Management

All headlines must be ≤60 characters.

**Strategies for staying under 60:**
- Use abbreviations when standard (mAb, CHO, HEK, cGMP)
- Remove filler words ("and", "the", "for" when possible)
- Use concise phrasing
- Avoid redundancy

**Examples:**

Before (70 chars): "Comprehensive Cell Culture Media Solutions for CHO-Based Workflows"
After (59 chars): "CHO Cell Culture Media for Bioprocessing Workflows" ✓

Before (65 chars): "Advanced Technical Support and Comprehensive Documentation"
After (47 chars): "Technical Support and Documentation" ✓

---

## Tone and Voice in Headlines

**Do:**
- Be confident and capable
- Be straightforward and clear
- Focus on outcomes and performance
- Use industry-standard terminology

**Don't:**
- Use buzzwords or marketing jargon
- Be overly promotional
- Use emotional or vague language
- Include prohibited terms (see brand guidelines)

**Examples:**

✓ Good: "Discover scalable global manufacturing capabilities"
✗ Avoid: "Unmatched, Revolutionary Manufacturing"

✓ Good: "Media Solutions for [Application]"
✗ Avoid: "The Perfect Media for All Your Needs"

✓ Good: "CHO Cell Culture Media to [Outcome]"
✗ Avoid: "Award-Winning, Best-in-Class CHO Media"

## Testing Headline Effectiveness

Before finalizing headlines, ask:

1. **SEO:** Does the H1 include the Primary Keyword?
2. **Hierarchy:** Is there exactly 1 H1, with H2s and H3s properly nested?
3. **Length:** Are all headlines ≤60 characters?
4. **Flow:** Do headlines follow a logical progression?
5. **Audience:** Will the target ICP understand and find value?
6. **Brand:** Are all prohibited terms removed?
7. **Keywords:** Are Secondary Keywords integrated naturally?
8. **Gaps:** Have you addressed important topics from competitor analysis?

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Multiple H1s:** Never use more than one H1
2. **Orphaned H3s:** H3s must always appear under an H2
3. **Keyword stuffing:** Don't force keywords unnaturally
4. **Too many levels:** Don't use H4, H5, H6
5. **Inconsistent structure:** Keep parallel structure within sections
6. **Over 60 chars:** Trim every headline to ≤60 characters
7. **Prohibited terms:** Scan for all variations of banned words
8. **Vague headlines:** Be specific about what each section covers
