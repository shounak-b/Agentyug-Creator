**Goal:** Synthesize all collected research and insights into a comprehensive, actionable content brief that includes strategically structured headlines, internal linking opportunities, target word count, content goal, and meta description.

---

## Why This Matters

This is the deliverable that guides content creation. A well-structured content brief ensures the landing page ranks for target keywords, aligns with brand guidelines, provides value to the target audience, and integrates seamlessly into the site architecture.

---

## Review All Collected Information

Before generating the brief, ensure you have:
- **Page Name** (from Step 1)
- **Primary Keyword** (from Step 1)
- **Secondary Keywords** (from Step 1)
- **Client Name** (from Step 1)
- **Page Content Brief Guide** (from Step 1)
- **Domains** (from Step 1)
- **Recommended Word Count Range** (from Step 2)
- **Page Level** (from Step 3)
- **Internal Linking Opportunities** (from Step 3)
- **Existing Page Headlines** (from Step 5, if available)
- **Competitor Headlines** (from Step 6)

---

## Instructions

### A. Generate Strategic Headline Structure

Create SEO-optimized headlines following these requirements:

**SEO Hierarchy:**
- **1 H1 heading** — Must include the Primary Keyword and describe the main topic
- **H2 headings** — Subtopics of the H1; major content sections
- **H3 headings** — Subtopics of the parent H2
- **Character limit** — All headings must be 60 characters or fewer
- **Logical flow** — Must follow a readable progression

**Content Strategy:**
- Analyze competitor headlines from Step 6 for effective patterns and gaps
- Ensure important topics from existing page (Step 5) aren't omitted
- Incorporate Secondary Keywords naturally into H2/H3 headings
- Align with Page Content Brief Guide and target audience needs
- Consider the client's messaging pillars as defined in [../brand-guidelines.md](../brand-guidelines.md)

See [headline-strategy.md](headline-strategy.md) for detailed headline creation guidance.

---

### B. Integrate Internal Linking Opportunities

Reference the relevant pages from Step 3. For each internal link, specify:
- **Anchor text** — from Step 3
- **URL** — from Step 3
- **Placement** — Which headline section the link appears under

Distribute links across multiple sections for balanced link equity.

**Example:**
```
Under H2: Key Features and Capabilities
- Link to "Advanced Reporting Tools" using anchor text "reporting and analytics"
```

---

### C. Apply Brand Guidelines

**CRITICAL:** All headlines MUST comply with the client's brand guidelines.

Reference: [../brand-guidelines.md](../brand-guidelines.md)

**Scan all headlines for prohibited terminology:**
- **Absolutes/Guarantees**: Avoid "ensure", "guarantee", "always", "all", "any", "100%", "effortless", "seamless"
- **Superlatives**: Avoid "best", "best-in-class", "breakthrough", "revolutionary", "cutting edge", "state-of-the-art", "unique", "unmatched", "perfect"
- **Antitrust terms**: Avoid "dominate", "eliminate competition", "market leader", "market share"
- **Regulatory terms**: Use "FDA Approved" vs "FDA Cleared" precisely; avoid "safe"
- **Vague terms**: Avoid "expertise", "only", "partner"

**Check all tense variations**: Present, past, future, plural forms (e.g., "ensures", "ensured", "ensuring")

**Replace with compliant alternatives:**
- "Ensure" → "Helps ensure", "Designed to"
- "Best" → "Among the best", "Outstanding"
- "Perfect" → "Well-suited for", "Optimized"

**Apply tone of voice:** Confident, capable, straightforward, outcome-driven, performance over polish

---

### D. Define Target Word Count Range

Use the recommended word count range from Step 2.
- Ensure minimum floor: 500 words
- Ensure maximum ceiling: 1500 words
- Consider page level and content depth

**Example:** `Target Word Count: 800-1200 words`

---

### E. Create Content Goal

Write 2-3 future tense sentences describing what the page will accomplish.

Base the goal on:
- Generated headlines and content structure
- Page Content Brief Guide from Step 1
- Target audience (ICP) and their needs
- Primary Keyword intent

Frame from user's perspective: what will they learn, achieve, or understand?

**Example:**
```
This page will help team leads and project managers understand how [Client Name]'s project management software supports planning, collaboration, and on-time delivery. It will highlight core capabilities such as task tracking, team dashboards, and reporting tools that help teams meet deadlines. Visitors will leave with a clear understanding of available plans and how to get started with a free trial.
```

---

### F. Generate Page Title

Write a page title for the `<title>` tag:
- **Format:** `{Primary Keyword} | {Brand Name}`
- **Length:** 50–60 characters
- **Review top-ranking SERP title tags** for the Primary Keyword to identify modifiers worth incorporating (e.g., year, "Free Trial", product qualifiers)

**Example:** `Project Management Software | [Client Name]`

---

### G. Generate Meta Description

Write a compelling meta description:
- **Length:** 150-160 characters
- **Include:** Primary Keyword naturally
- **Summarize:** Page'˜s value proposition
- **Use:** Action-oriented, outcome-driven language
- **Apply:** Brand guidelines (avoid prohibited terminology)
- **Format:** Write as complete sentences (not fragments)

**Example:**
```
Discover project management software designed to help teams plan, track, and deliver work on time. Flexible plans available for teams of any size.
```
