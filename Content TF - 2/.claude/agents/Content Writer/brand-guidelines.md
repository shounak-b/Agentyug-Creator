- **Related forms**: adjectives, adverbs, nouns (e.g., "perfect", "perfectly", "perfection")
- **Compound usage**: terms used in phrases or combined with other words (e.g., "best-in-class", "state-of-the-art")

When reviewing content, search for the root term and all its variations to ensure comprehensive compliance with terminology standards.
