# Thermo Fisher Brand Guidelines

## Terminology Standards

CRITICAL: Avoid buzzwords that create legal/regulatory risks or imply unsubstantiated claims.

### How to Apply Terminology Checks

**Check for ALL variations** of problematic terms, including:
- **Tense variations**: present, past, and future forms (e.g., "ensure", "ensures", "ensured", "ensuring")
- **Plural forms**: both singular and plural (e.g., "guarantee", "guarantees")
- **Related forms**: adjectives, adverbs, nouns (e.g., "perfect", "perfectly", "perfection")
- **Compound usage**: terms used in phrases or combined with other words (e.g., "best-in-class", "state-of-the-art")

When reviewing content, search for the root term and all its variations to ensure comprehensive compliance with terminology standards.

## Bioprocessing Messaging Framework

### Brand positioning

**Tagline**: "Powering results: From molecule to medicine"

**Core approach**: Focus on integrated workflow solutions, not individual product features.

### Key differentiators ("Because Only Thermo Fisher")

Always integrate these when relevant:
- Decades of experience improving bioprocess efficiency
- Scalable platforms that increase yield and reduce time-to-clinic
- Leadership in sustainable bioprocessing
- Technical guidance and transparency for decision-making

### Five messaging pillars

Build content around these customer needs:

1. **Accelerate time to market**
2. **Maximize resource efficiency**
3. **Enable high product yield and efficacy**
4. **Deliver on sustainability**
5. **Reduce risk in supply and regulatory**

### Target audiences

| Segment | Key roles |
|---------|-----------|
| Biopharma | Directors of manufacturing, MSAT leads, QA/QC directors |
| Biotech | Process development leads, R&D scientists |
| CDMO/CMO | Principal scientists, tech transfer leads |
| Cell & Gene Therapy | Principal scientists, clinical operations leads |

**Address their**: Goals, responsibilities, pain points, and values in content.

## Tone of voice

### Sound like this:
- Confident, capable, grounded
- Resolute, reliable, efficient
- Straightforward, outcome-driven
- Clear, simple, purposeful
- Performance over polish

### Never sound like this:
- Overly emotional or vague
- Buzzword-heavy or self-promotional
- Aggressive, overly familiar, or gimmicky
- Sarcastic or hyperbolic
- Company-first (always put customer first)

## Messaging hierarchy

Connect product-level content to the group-level brand promise:
- **Product level**: "Powering results in [specific application] using [product name]"
- **Group level**: "Powering results from molecule to medicine"

Ensure all communications ladder up to the overarching brand promise.
